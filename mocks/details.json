Misspelled domains:**\n- gooogle.com (extra 'o')\n- micros0ft.com (zero instead of 'o')\n- paypa1.com (number '1' instead of 'l')\n\n**2. Subdomain spoofing:**\n- paypal.secure-login.malicious-site.com\n- amazon.verification.phishing-domain.net\n\n**3. URL shorteners:**\n- bit.ly/xyz123\n- tinyurl.com/abc456\n(Legitimate but can hide malicious destinations)\n\n**4. IP addresses instead of domains:**\n- http://192.168.1.100/login\n- http://203.0.113.45/verify\n\n**5. Unusual top-level domains (TLDs):**\n- company.tk, .ga, .ml, .cf\n(Free TLDs often used by attackers)\n\n**6. Homograph attacks:**\n- аpple.com (Cyrillic 'а' instead of Latin 'a')\n- paypal.com with visually similar Unicode characters\n\n**Best practice:** Always hover over links before clicking to inspect the actual URL, and when in doubt, manually type known-good URLs into your browser."
